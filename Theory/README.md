this is the first assignment by akshay saini sir where i will learn basic react by answering diffrent kinds of questions.



## Chapter 01 - Inception

### Q: What is Emmet?

Emmet is a plugin for VS Code that allows you to write HTML and CSS code faster by using shorthand abbreviations.

### Q: Difference between a Library and Framework?

A library would be like a toolbox that contains specific tools such as a hammer, screwdriver, or saw. You can use these tools as needed to build your house, but you have to decide how to use them and in what order.

On the other hand, a framework would be like a blueprint or plan for the entire house. It defines the overall structure of the house, including the placement of walls, doors, and windows. You still need tools to build the house, but the framework provides the rules and guidelines for how those tools should be used and where they should be applied.

So, in the context of coding, a library provides specific functions or features that can be used to perform specific tasks, while a framework provides a set of rules and guidelines for building an entire application.


### Q: What is CDN? Why do we use it?

A CDN is a network of servers located around the world that helps websites deliver their content more quickly and reliably to users. It improves website performance and user experience by reducing latency, improving availability, and reducing bandwidth costs.


### Q: Why is React known as React?

 The name "React" reflects the library's ability to react quickly to changes in the data, making it a popular choice for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.


 ### Q: What is crossorigin in script tag?

 When you load a script file from a different domain (e.g. a script hosted on a CDN or a different website), the browser considers it to be a "cross-origin" request. In order to protect the user's security and privacy, modern web browsers impose certain restrictions on these cross-origin requests.

One such restriction is the "Same-Origin Policy", which states that a script loaded from a different domain cannot access or modify resources (such as cookies, local storage, or other web APIs) that belong to the original domain.


### Q: What is difference between React and ReactDOM?


React is a tool used to create building blocks for websites and apps. ReactDOM is a tool used to show those building blocks as a complete website or app on the internet.


### Q: What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

the react.development.js file is used during the development process to help with debugging, while the react.production.js file is used in production to optimize performance.

### Q . What is the difference between async and defer ?

Using async and defer with the HTML <script> tag can help improve the loading speed of web pages by controlling when and how scripts are loaded and executed. async loads and executes the script as soon as possible, while defer loads the script in the background and defers its execution until after the page has finished loading.
